Act as a Senior AI Systems Architect and Technical Project Auditor.

You are reviewing my project "SkyConnect SL" — an AI-powered travel discovery and airline assistant platform focused on Sri Lanka.

Your task is to:

1. Analyze the entire codebase.
2. Identify completed modules and implemented features.
3. Identify architectural decisions already made.
4. Detect partially implemented features.
5. Detect missing but required system components.
6. Provide a structured technical progress report suitable for presenting to a university research supervisor.

-----------------------------------------
PROJECT CONTEXT
-----------------------------------------

SkyConnect SL is designed as:

- Hybrid LLM + Rule-Based Intent Router
- Travel & airline API-integrated platform
- Sri Lanka focused travel discovery system
- AI chatbot + travel intelligence engine
- Scalable cloud-ready backend

Core Planned Components:

1. Frontend (React / Next.js)
2. Backend (Node.js / Express or similar)
3. LLM Integration (OpenAI or similar)
4. Intent Classification Layer
5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
6. Travel APIs Integration (Airline, Google Places, etc.)
7. Database (Supabase or similar)
8. Image Storage (Cloudinary or similar)
9. Authentication & Role Management
10. Admin Dashboard
11. Logging & Monitoring
12. Deployment Configuration

-----------------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIRED
-----------------------------------------

Generate a structured report with the following sections:

1. Executive Summary
2. Completed Work (Detailed Technical Breakdown)
   - Frontend Components Implemented
   - Backend Services Implemented
   - AI Modules Implemented
   - API Integrations Completed
   - Database Structure Created
3. Architecture Overview
   - Current System Flow
   - LLM Interaction Model
   - Intent Routing Strategy
4. Partially Completed Modules
5. Missing Critical Components
6. Technical Debt / Risks
7. Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized Roadmap)
   - Phase 1: Stabilization
   - Phase 2: Feature Completion
   - Phase 3: Scalability & Research Enhancement
8. Suggested Research Contribution Angle
   (How this can be positioned as an AI systems research project)

-----------------------------------------
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------------------

- Be technically detailed.
- Infer missing pieces from the codebase.
- Identify design patterns used.
- Comment on scalability readiness.
- Suggest improvements aligned with modern AI system design (2026 standard).
- Write in a formal academic + industry hybrid tone.

Do NOT summarize lightly.
Produce a supervisor-ready technical review.
