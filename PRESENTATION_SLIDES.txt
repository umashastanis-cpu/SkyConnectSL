SLIDE 2: BACKGROUND OF THE RESEARCH PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------
Title: Tourism Industry Challenges in Sri Lanka

Key Problems:
• Fragmented service ecosystem
  - Travelers struggle to find reliable local providers
  - No centralized platform for tours, hotels, transport

• Information asymmetry
  - Difficult to verify authentic vs. fraudulent operators
  - Trust and safety concerns

• Inefficient booking process
  - Manual arrangements via multiple channels
  - Time-consuming research and coordination

• Limited personalization
  - Generic packages don't match individual preferences


SLIDE 3: PROBLEM JUSTIFICATION & SYMPTOMS
------------------------------------------
Title: Identified Symptoms

For Travelers:
✗ 60%+ spend excessive time researching separately
✗ High abandonment due to complex processes
✗ Safety concerns with unverified providers

For Local Service Providers:
✗ Limited digital presence and visibility
✗ Difficulty reaching international tourists
✗ No platform for showcasing services

Economic Impact:
→ Lost revenue for local businesses
→ Poor user experience
→ Missed tourism opportunities


SLIDE 4: RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
-----------------------------
Title: Research Objectives

Primary Objective:
Develop an intelligent, mobile-first platform connecting travelers with verified local service providers in Sri Lanka

Specific Objectives:
1. Secure authentication & dual-role user profiles
   (Travelers & Service Partners)

2. Dynamic service listing & discovery system
   (Tours, Hotels, Transport, Activities)

3. Admin dashboard with partner verification
   (Quality control & approval workflows)

4. Personalized recommendations
   (AI-powered trip planning - future phase)


SLIDE 5: PROJECT LIMITATIONS
-----------------------------
Title: Limitations of the Project

Technical Limitations:
• Mobile app only (React Native) - no web version
• Payment gateway not yet integrated
• No real-time chat between users and partners
• Requires constant internet connectivity

Operational Limitations:
• Geographic scope: Sri Lanka only
• Language: English only (no Sinhala/Tamil yet)
• Limited scalability testing with large user base

Resource Constraints:
• Academic timeline: 6 months
• Firebase free-tier usage limits
• Small-scale testing environment


SLIDE 6: LITERATURE REVIEW & RESEARCH GAP
------------------------------------------
Title: Literature Review & Research Gap

Existing Solutions:
┌─────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│ Platform    │ Strengths       │ Gaps             │
├─────────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Booking.com │ Hotels          │ No local tours   │
│ Airbnb      │ P2P marketplace │ Limited SL       │
│ TripAdvisor │ Reviews         │ No booking       │

SLIDE 10: CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
---------------------------------
Title: Challenges Encountered

Technical Challenges:

1. Firestore Complex Queries
   Problem: Required composite indexes
   Solution: Generated via Firebase console & CLI

2. TypeScript Type Safety
   Problem: Data type mismatches
   Solution: Created robust type definitions

3. Admin Security
   Problem: Can't expose admin keys in mobile app
   Solution: Separate Python backend with Admin SDK

4. Email Verification
   Problem: Users bypassing verification
   Solution: Verification check screen
